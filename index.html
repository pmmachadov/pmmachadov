        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Digital sector professional in training,
          interested in front end web development.
        </p>
        <p> My competencies are:</p>
        <p>
          - Attention to order and
          quality.
          - Planification and organization.

        <p>
          I am learning about:
          react
          HTML5 / CSS3
          javascript
          Digital Marketing + SEO
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done remote work. The opportunity to do virtual work has developed my more autonomous aspect, while
          working in person has helped me learn from the team from another angle.</p>

        <p> Design and implement React components following the Single Responsibility Principle to improve readability
          and
          facilitate future modifications.</p>

        <p>Keep the code DRY to avoid redundancy and improve the efficiency and maintainability of the code.</p>

        <p>Use Hooks and APIs to integrate backend functionality and manage state and side effects in components.</p>

        <p>Implement interactive galleries, contact pages, and calendars using component reuse to maximize consistency
          and minimize
          redundant code.</p>

        <p>Create feature-rich interfaces with maps and images, implementing data immutability in React to improve
          application
          performance and reliability.</p>

        <p>Develop interactive components using React and Material-UI.</p>

        <p>Apply custom styles and themes using Material-UI's customization capabilities.</p>

        <p>Handle application state using React Hooks or Redux as needed.</p>

        <p>Consume external APIs to get and send data through the application.</p>

        <p>Ensuring that the application is responsive and looks good on mobile devices and screens of different
          sizes.</p>

        <p>Implement animations and transitions to improve the user experience.</p>

        <p>Optimize application performance using lazy loading techniques and image optimization.</p>

        <p>Analyze and understand project requirements and design specifications.</p>

        <p>Work collaboratively with the design and backend team to develop the user interface and logic of the
          application.</p>

        <p>Conduct code reviews and collaborate in the continuous improvement of development.</p>

        <p>Document the code and the implemented functionalities.</p>

        <p>Ensure the security and protection of the application against possible vulnerabilities.</p>

        <p>Perform performance tests and optimize the loading speed of the application.</p>

        <p>Participate in meetings and communicate effectively with the team and clients for the progress of the
          project.</p>
